2022.08.25 ：V1.2可以get和Post
	1、暂时发现问题：lasermarking完如果再按一次lasermarking则还会打标一次，
	     原因是逻辑写成先打标，后post。
	     解决办法：加条件，先get ok，后打标。

	1.There is no laser marking if we press foot switch.Only software button can be used for laser marking.

2.We need to re-size the text freely by dragging the mouse.

3.Aim beam size is not updated immediately if we change from one Tagid to other Tagid.It shows the previous AIM size only.

4.This software needs to run on MASTER SLAVE combination of V-Lase with LAN connection.I hope you remember how we have done for previous Auto aim softwares.

5.MASTER SLAVE is necessary because VLase has less memory and it could not run the google chrome so internet cannot be connected and government website cannot be accessed.
